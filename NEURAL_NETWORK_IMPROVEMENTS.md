# Neural Network Improvements

## Overview
This document explains the improvements made to your neural network to better manage thresholds and weights for more effective learning.

## Key Problems Solved

### 1. **Weight Initialization**
**Problem:** Weights started at 0, making initial learning very slow.

**Solution:** 
- Connections now use **Xavier/Glorot initialization** with random weights between -0.5 and 0.5
- This allows the network to start learning immediately rather than waiting for weights to build up

### 2. **Threshold Management**
**Problem:** All neurons had the same threshold (1.0), which wasn't optimal for different neuron types.

**Solution:** **Hierarchical thresholds** based on neuron function:
- **Input neurons:** 0.5 (easier to activate from sensors)
- **Middle neurons:** 1.5 (moderate processing requirement)
- **Output neurons:** 2.0 (need more evidence before acting)

### 3. **Adaptive Learning**
**Problem:** Fixed learning rate and no threshold adaptation.

**Solution:** 
- **Adaptive learning rate** that decreases over time for stability: `learning_rate = base_learning_rate * exp(-time / 5000)`
- **Threshold adaptation** every 100 frames based on neuron activity
- **Weight bounds** to prevent explosion (-1.0 to 2.0)

### 4. **Balanced Reward System**
**Problem:** Only punishment, no positive reinforcement.

**Solution:**
- **Punishment** (0.2) for hitting walls
- **Small rewards** (0.01) for successful movement without collision
- Creates balanced learning environment

## New Features

### **Neuron Self-Adaptation**
- Neurons track their activation frequency
- Automatically adjust thresholds:
  - **Over-active neurons** → Increase threshold (harder to fire)
  - **Under-active neurons** → Decrease threshold (easier to fire)

### **Connection Weight Management**
- Smart initialization for faster learning
- Bounded weights prevent instability
- Adaptive learning rate for convergence

### **Network-Level Learning**
- Periodic threshold adaptation (every 100 frames)
- Learning rate decay for stability
- Balanced punishment/reward system

## Expected Improvements

1. **Faster Learning:** Network will start adapting immediately due to proper weight initialization
2. **Better Balance:** Different thresholds for different neuron types creates proper information flow
3. **Stability:** Adaptive learning rate and weight bounds prevent erratic behavior
4. **Self-Regulation:** Neurons automatically balance their sensitivity based on usage

## Usage Tips

1. **Monitor** neuron colors to see activation patterns
2. **Adjust** `base_learning_rate` (currently 0.05) if learning is too fast/slow
3. **Experiment** with threshold values in `_ready()` for different behaviors
4. **Watch** for balanced red/white neuron activity - all red or all white indicates problems

## Technical Details

- **Weight bounds:** [-1.0, 2.0]
- **Learning rate decay:** Exponential with 5000-frame half-life
- **Adaptation frequency:** Every 100 frames
- **Threshold range:** 0.3x to 3.0x of base threshold
- **Reward ratio:** 20:1 punishment to reward (0.2 vs 0.01)

Your neural network should now learn much more effectively to navigate and avoid walls!
